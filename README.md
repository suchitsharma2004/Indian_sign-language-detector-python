## 🔭 Features of the Project

- **Real-Time Detection:** Uses OpenCV for live video feed processing.  
- **Hand Gesture Recognition:** MediaPipe powers accurate hand tracking and gesture recognition.  
- **Indian Sign Language Support:** Detects and translates ISL gestures into text.  
- **Python-Powered:** Built with Python for flexibility and scalability.  

## 📌 Tools and Technologies Used

- **MediaPipe:** For robust and efficient hand tracking.  
- **OpenCV:** For video feed processing and computer vision tasks.  
- **Python:** Core programming language for implementation.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Integrated for gesture classification.  

## 🌱 Goals of the Project

- Enhance communication for individuals using Indian Sign Language.  
- Build a user-friendly and efficient solution for real-time ISL interpretation.  
- Leverage AI/ML to improve gesture recognition accuracy.  

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Extend the system to support more complex ISL gestures.  
- Develop a mobile application for on-the-go ISL detection.  
- Integrate text-to-speech functionality for verbal output.
